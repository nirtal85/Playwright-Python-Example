## üåê Browser Testing

This project is tested with [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com), enabling cross-browser and mobile testing on real devices in the cloud.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

### Clone the project

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nirtal85/Playwright-Python-Example
cd playwright-python
```

### Create and activate a virtual environment then Install project dependencies

#### For Windows:
```bash
pip install uv
uv venv
.\env\Scripts\activate
uv pip sync uv.lock
```

#### For Mac:
```bash

uv venv
source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip sync uv.lock
```

### Install playwright

```bash
playwright install
```

## üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

When no browser was selected then chrome will be used.

* Run according to tags:

```bash
pytest -m <tag_name>
```

## üìä Viewing Test Results

### Install Allure Commandline To View Test results

#### For Windows:

Follow the instructions [here](https://scoop.sh/) to install Scoop.<br>
Run the following command to install Allure using Scoop:

```bash
scoop install allure
```

#### For Mac:

```bash
brew install allure
```

### View Results Locally:

```bash
allure serve allure-results
```

### View Results Online:

[View allure results via Github pages](https://nirtal85.github.io/Playwright-Python-Example/)

### View trace results:

1. Navigate to the [Playwright Trace Viewer](https://trace.playwright.dev/)
2. Locate the trace file stored under the test-results folder. This file is generated after running your tests. Click on the 'Upload' button in the Playwright Trace Viewer and select your trace file.
3. After uploading, the trace viewer will display a detailed timeline of events that occurred during your test. This includes network requests, JavaScript execution, and browser interactions. You can click on individual events for more details.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è View Help And Other CLI Options
